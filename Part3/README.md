for solving the first question I usese online python editor. if you are going to run this program in other editor it might ot work as expected 
due to indentation error.


1. copy the code and paste them in editor. Note that you should use python editor.
2. do not do any cahnge in the code in terms of names of data menmbers and function used
3. do the indentation where it is necessary
